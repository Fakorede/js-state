# js-state

js-state is a static analysis tool that runs through a given snippet of code and logs the state variables. It uses the p[babel parser](https://babeljs.io/docs/babel-parser) to build an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and traverses through it using the [visitor Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern).
